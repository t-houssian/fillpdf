# Overview
This is a simple package to make filling pdfs much easier. I have delt with a lot projects that involve manipulating pdfs in python. I found no easy solution for writting, or flattening pdfs, so I decided to make a library to make this task much easier. As a young software engineer I kept this library really simple but practicle and am open to any input for the future!

- Fills pdfs
- Lists fields in pdf
- Flattens pdfs (Turns to a non-editable pdf)

# Function Documentation
    import fillpdf
    from fillpdf import fillpdfs
##### get_form_fields (returns the data_dict)
    get_form_fields(input_pdf_path)
- input_pdf_path- path to your pdf you want to alter (including the pdf name could just leave as 'blank.pdf' if the pdf is in your current directory)
###### For Example:
    fillpdfs.get_form_fields('blank.pdf')

##### print_form_fields (prints the data_dict)
    print_form_fields(input_pdf_path)
- input_pdf_path- path to your pdf you want to alter (including the pdf name could just leave as 'blank.pdf' if the pdf is in your current directory)
###### For Example:
    fillpdfs.print_form_fields('blank.pdf')
    
##### write_fillable_pdf
    write_fillable_pdf(input_pdf_path, output_pdf_path, data_dict, flatten=False)
- input_pdf_path- path to your pdf you want to alter (including the pdf name could just leave as 'blank.pdf' if the pdf is in your current directory)
- output_pdf_path- path of where you want your pdf to write to (including the pdf name could just leave as 'new.pdf' to write to current directory)
- data_dict- dictionary that contains the fields to write to as your key and what to write to it as your value (get this from the get_form_fields function)
- flatten (default=False)- If True, then the fields will become uneditable when you write to the pdf.
###### For Example:
    data_dict = {'Address 1 Text Box': '500 West Main Street',
    'Driving License Check Box': 'Yes',
    'Language 1 Check Box': 'Off',}
    
    fillpdfs.write_fillable_pdf('blank.pdf', 'new.pdf', data_dict)
- For radio boxes ('Off' = not filled, 'Yes' = filled) 

##### flatten_pdf
    flatten_pdf(input_pdf_path, output_pdf_path, as_images=False)
- input_pdf_path- path to your pdf you want to alter (including the pdf name could just leave as 'blank.pdf' if the pdf is in your current directory)
- output_pdf_path- path of where you want your pdf to write to (including the pdf name could just leave as 'new.pdf' to write to current directory)
- as_images=False- Default is False meaning it will update each individual annotation and set
        it to False. True means it will convert to images and then reinsert into the
        pdf. Try this if the first is not working. (this image technique requires poppler.)
###### For Example:
    fillpdfs.flatten_pdf('new.pdf', 'newflat.pdf')

# Future Work
* Add perfect fill (sometimes does not fill random things ie. drop down lists)
* give option to place text by coordinate
* easier way to fill the data dictionary in write_fillable_pdf function
* fill drop downs
